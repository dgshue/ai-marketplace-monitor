# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Web UI rebuilt mobile-first around a review queue: one listing at a time, swipe right to keep / left to
  dismiss, tap for details, Queue / Reviewed / All views, keyboard triage on desktop (`J`/`K`, `→`/`←`,
  `1`–`5`, `Enter`, `O`, `Z`, `H`, `R`, `?`), grouped-list Items / Sources / Status screens, and a web
  app manifest so it can be pinned to a phone home screen. Every previous capability (TOML editor, section
  forms, sources set-up, status, logs, CSV export, noVNC link) is carried over.

### Added
- Option `review_rating` (marketplace-level, overridable per item, 1-5, default 3) splitting the AI score
  into three tiers: below `review_rating` a listing is rated once, cached and only tracked; at or above it
  the listing enters the web UI's review queue; at or above `rating` it also sends a notification.
  A config with `review_rating` above `rating` is rejected with an error naming both. Activity rows and the
  per-item summary carry `review_threshold`, the new verdict `low` covers the bottom tier, and the review
  queue, the Reviewed list, the tab badge, the "N to review" line and the day counts all exclude it — the
  All view's new **Low** chip is the one place it surfaces. Item cards show both thresholds as steppers.
- `/api/listing/flag` accepts `kept`; user flags now carry `reviewed_at`, and activity rows expose both,
  so the review queue is derived from the user's own decisions (kept, hidden, or rated).

### Fixed
- Facebook vehicle listings cached a wrong price: vehicle detail pages have no price element, so the
  detail scraper fell back to the first `$...` in the seller's description — the down payment on a dealer
  listing (`$550` for a $5,500 Civic). The value is plausible, so the junk-artifact filter let it through.
  The search tile's price, which is what the AI was rated against, now wins outright whenever the tile has
  one. Already-cached listings self-heal on their next encounter.

## [0.10.2] - 2026-07-17

### Added
- Option `sort_by` to order Facebook search results by `suggested`, `new` (newest first), `price_ascend`, `price_descend`, or `distance_ascend` ([#323](https://github.com/BoPeng/ai-marketplace-monitor/issues/323))
- Web UI "Export CSV" button that downloads all found (notified) listings with link, price, rating, and details ([#334](https://github.com/BoPeng/ai-marketplace-monitor/issues/334))
- Docker image bundling Xvfb + Playwright Chromium + noVNC, with a "Browser" button in the web UI that exposes the live Chromium session for solving Facebook CAPTCHA / interactive logins ([#310](https://github.com/BoPeng/ai-marketplace-monitor/issues/310))
- GitHub Actions workflow publishing multi-arch (amd64/arm64) images to `ghcr.io/bopeng/ai-marketplace-monitor`

### Fixed
- WebUI startup failure on older FastAPI versions ([#315](https://github.com/BoPeng/ai-marketplace-monitor/pull/315))
- Stale runtime version reporting ([#314](https://github.com/BoPeng/ai-marketplace-monitor/pull/314))
